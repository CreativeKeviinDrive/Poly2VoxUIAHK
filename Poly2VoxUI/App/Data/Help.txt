Loading Files onto Poly2vox
-If you don't know how to load the file onto the gui. make sure you copy your zip file containing the
3DS and the textures onto The Poly2vox folder containing the Poly2vox.exe!

Converting the Model!
If you want to convert the model to a .3ds make sure the .PNG files are in a ZIP. but also make sure
the textures are 8 word-characters or less. otherwise poly2vox will not convert the textures.
Correct = "Cressela.png"
Incorrect = "Cresselia.png"

For multiple images you can have more than 1 texture on there.
